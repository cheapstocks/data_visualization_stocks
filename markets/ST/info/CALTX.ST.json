    "description": "Calliditas Therapeutics AB provides pharmaceutical products for patients with niche indications. The company is headquartered in Stockholm, Stockholm and currently employs 46 full-time employees. The company went IPO on 2018-06-29. The company is focused on the development and commercialization of its product candidate Nefecon, a treatment for patients with inflammatory kidney disease (IgA nephropathy) who are at risk of progressing to renal failure. Nefecon is derived from the TARGIT technology, in which the capsule containing the active drug substance is coated in a way that the capsule remains intact as it passes through the stomach and intestine until it reaches the lower small intestine, where the release of content takes place. Nefeco combines time lag effect with a concentrated release of the active substance budesonide, within a designated target area.",
