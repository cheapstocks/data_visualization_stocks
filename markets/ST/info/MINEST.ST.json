    "description": "Minesto AB engages in the development of technology for the production of renewable electricity from tidal and ocean currents. The company is headquartered in Vaestra Froelunda, Vastra Gotalands and currently employs 58 full-time employees. The company went IPO on 2015-11-09. The firm's product Deep Green, is a power plant that converts energy from tidal stream flows into electricity by way somewhat similar to the posture of a wind kite. The kite assembly, consisting of a wing and turbine, is attached by a tether to a fixed point on the ocean bed. As water flows over the hydrodynamic wind, a lift force is generated which allows the device to move smoothly through the water and for the turbine to rotate hence generating electricity. The firm has offices in Sweden, North Ireland and the United Kingdom. The firm is co-owned by SAAB, BGA Invest, Verdane Capital, Encubator and Midroc.",
