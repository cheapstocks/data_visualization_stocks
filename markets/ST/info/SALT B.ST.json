    "description": "SaltX Technology Holding AB engages in the development and trade of energy storage technology that utilizes nano-coated salt. The company is headquartered in Hagersten, Stockholm. The company went IPO on 2015-04-22. The firm operates through its wholly owned subsidiary ClimateWell AB, which owns the SaltX patents and trademarks. SaltX can be applied in solar-powered heating and cooling in buildings, heat-driven air conditioning in heavy-duty vehicles and gas-fired water heaters, among others. The SaltX technology is based in two tanks connected in vacuum, the Reactor, which holds the salt crystals and the Condenser, where liquid condensates. To charge the crystals and chemically store heating energy in the salt crystals, a heat source, such as energy from the sun, excess heat from a gas burner or waste heat from an engine, is connected to the Reactor.",
