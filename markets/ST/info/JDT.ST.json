    "description": "JonDeTech Sensors AB engages in the development of sensor and detection technology. The company is headquartered in Stockholm, Stockholm. The company went IPO on 2018-05-25. Sensors enable applications within the temperature and flux measurement fields. Thermopiles generate a direct, proportional voltage response when subjected to infrared radiation. The sensor registers wavelengths of visual light up to the middle of infrared region. The geometrical configuration enables the sensor to measure heat flux, as well as temperature. The sensor is less than 0.2 millimetre thin and is made using plastic membrane. Applications include: presence detection, heat flux and heat sensing, among others.",
