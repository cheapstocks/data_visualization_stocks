    "description": "SeaTwirl AB is a development company. The company is headquartered in Goeteborg, Vastra Gotalands. The company went IPO on 2016-12-22. The firm operates as a manufacturer and designer of floating wind turbine customized for the ocean. The firm's technology uses a vertical axis wind turbine with a tower that is attached to a floating structure that stretches deep below the water\u2019s surface. The wind turbine, tower and submerged structure, which has a buoyancy element and keel, are fixed together and rotate as a single unit. The water carries the full weight of the structure and when the wind turbine captures wind energy the structure is stabilized by the keel like the function of a sailing boat. The generator housing, which is wrapped around the tower at the base of the wind turbine above the surface of the water, contains the generator that transforms the kinetic energy of the wind turbine into electrical energy.",
